# Zenith Encoder and Decoder

[Zenith Encoder and Decoder Tool](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mateo-cogeanu/Zenith/blob/main/Zenith_encoder_decoder.html) - A web-based tool for encoding and decoding Zenith audio files.

## Description

Zenith Encoder and Decoder is a simple, web-based tool that allows users to upload MP3 files and encode them into the Zenith audio format (.zth). The encoding applies a custom algorithm to store the audio data. Users can also upload Zenith (.zth) files to decode and play the audio directly in their browser, without the need for external software.

## Features

- **Encoder**: Upload an MP3 file, encode it into the Zenith (.zth) format, and download the encoded file.
- **Decoder**: Upload a Zenith file, decode it, and play the audio directly in the browser.
- **Custom Encoding**: Zenith format uses a unique encoding method to transform MP3 files for storage.
- **Browser-Based**: No external software required for encoding or decoding, all operations are done in the browser.
